Your face makes onions cry.
You're the reason why the middle finger exists.
You're a grey sprinkle on a rainbow cupcake.
Light travels faster than sound which is why you seemed bright until you spoke.
I'll never forget the first time we met. But I'll never stop trying.
Hold still. I'm trying to imagine you with personality.
You are so full of shit, the toilet's jealous. -Jinx Monsoon, RuPaul's Drag Race
Keep talking, someday you'll say something intelligent.
You're always lost in thought. It must be unfamiliar territory.
